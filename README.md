# MyWorkouts

This is the raw code for the MyWorkouts site. You can view the website [here](https://my-workouts-php.herokuapp.com/) in a much prettier format.

MyWorkouts! is a website that allows users to discover specific exercises based their chosen parameters.
There are 2 different user permission levels: 
 • Guest accounts can search for exercises based on what equipment they have and which muscle groups they want to train
 • Registered accounts can change their password, search, and also save workouts to their own personal workouts page with info stored in a MySQL database

Tools Used: HTML/CSS/JS, Bootstrap, PHP, SQL, Rest Api, Ajax

Note: I have taken out the config folder containing my DB credentials because I did not want to post them online.
