# MyWorkouts

This is the raw code for the MyWorkouts site.  
~~Currently Heroku has taken down their free website hosting so soon I will be deploying it somewhere else.~~  
~~Update!  
I was able to host the site for free, change the domain name (to the very stylish myworkouts.ml), and add SSL certification with Cloudflare.  
You can view the website <a href="https://myworkouts.ml" target="_blank">***here***</a> and feel free to make an account and check out all the features for yourself!~~

Update: Got taken down again working on fixing it. See the website <a href="https://myworkoutsrc.000webhostapp.com/" target="_blank">***here***</a> 

MyWorkouts! is a website that allows users to discover specific exercises based their chosen parameters.
There are 2 different user permission levels: 
 • Guest accounts can search for exercises based on what equipment they have and which muscle groups they want to train
 • Registered accounts can change their password, search, and also save workouts to their own personal workouts page with info stored in a MySQL database

Tools Used: HTML/CSS/JS, Bootstrap, PHP, SQL, Rest Api, Ajax

Note: I have taken out the config folder containing my DB credentials because I did not want to post them online.
